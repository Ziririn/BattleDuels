# Battle Duels

**Battle Duels** is a minimalistic real-time strategy game. In its core it's a duel of two generals - warlords. When one falls - the other wins. That's why the game was previously called "Warlords' Battle Duels" or "WBD".

The game serves as a sandbox or a playground, where players can spawn some armies and then control them to test their strength against the computer opponent or enjoy the show of two AIs fighting each other.

One of the distinctive **features** of this game is the fact that each unit has its own behaviour. While they are given orders, they each act on their own accord and can even flee the battle in certain circumstances.

Made with Unity.

## How to play

The game is meant to be played with a mouse and a keyboard.

* At the start of the game you will be able to spawn units on the battlefield via F1-F3 and F5-F7 keys.
* Use mouse to control the camera: move it around, zoom in and out to get a better view of the battle.
* Select your army and command it to move or attack some area. There are buttons for different modes.
* Send your warlord to attack whenever you want to. He is a powerful figure on the field!
* Whenever you want, switch of the controls to let the AIs decide the outcome of the battle.
* Wield the powers of time itself, changing the speed of the battle via buttons on the screen!
* Specific controls can be found in the game's help menu.

**The goal:** defeat the enemy warlord.

## Unit types

There are four different unit types in the **Battle Duels**, each with their strengths and weaknesses:

- **Swordsmen**
  
  These guys strike fast and good. They are the bulk of any army. Shields protect them from both arrows and blades.
  
- **Lancers**
  
  Having greater reach and higher damage than swordsmen, lancers lack speed and are less useful in close melee. However, their high critical chance makes them very dangerous.
  
- **Archers**

  Range. You dont need to worry about enemies if they are dead before they reach you.
  
- **Warlords**

  Wielding powerfull axes, warlords are the strongest warriors to ever walk the plains of this game's world. In a couple of strikes they can get rid of the entire squads of soldiers. Be careful though, you only have one.
